## Overview

This application leverages Python frameworks and LLM technologies to create an intelligent WhatsApp automation service. It uses WhatsApp Web API libraries for messaging functionality, combined with LLMs for natural language processing and multimodal capabilities for handling various content types (text, images, audio).

## Features

- **WhatsApp Integration**: QR code-based authentication with session persistence
- **Message Scheduling**: Automated message sending at specified times
- **LLM-Powered Chatbot**: Intelligent automated responses using large language models
- **Multimodal Support**: Process and generate text, images, and audio content
- **Web Interface**: Responsive dashboard to manage all functionalities
- **Continuous Operation**: Runs in the cloud without requiring physical devices
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Python 3.10+**: Core programming language
- **FastAPI**: Web server framework for API endpoints
- **Selenium/Playwright**: For WhatsApp Web automation
- **LangChain/LlamaIndex**: LLM orchestration frameworks
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For model integration
- **Celery**: Task scheduling and queue management

### LLM & AI Components
- **Integration options**:
  - OpenAI API (GPT-4, DALL-E, Whisper)
  - Hugging Face models (local deployment)
  - Anthropic Claude
  - Llama/Mistral models
- **Vector Database**: For embedding storage and retrieval (using Chroma, FAISS or Pinecone)

### Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for user data and configurations
- **Redis**: For caching and session management
- **S3-compatible storage**: For media files and model weights

### Frontend
- **Streamlit/Gradio**: For rapid UI development
- **Flask/Django Templates**: For more customized web interfaces
- **Vue.js/React** (optional): For advanced UI requirements

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda)
- API keys for chosen LLM providers
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whatsapp-llm-automation.git
cd whatsapp-llm-automation
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration settings.

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

## Deployment

### Railway Deployment
Railway provides an excellent platform for deploying Python applications with both PostgreSQL and Redis support.

1. Install Railway CLI:
```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
```

2. Login and initialize project:
```bash
railway login
railway init
```

3. Add PostgreSQL and Redis plugins through Railway dashboard.

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
railway variables set LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key DB_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```

5. Deploy the application:
```bash
railway up
```

### Docker Deployment
For containerized deployment:

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t whatsapp-llm-bot .
```

2. Run using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Alternative Deployment Options
- **Render**: Similar to Railway with good Python support
- **Fly.io**: Good for global distribution
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: For more complex deployments with full control

## Usage

1. Access the web interface via your deployed URL.
2. Create an account and login.
3. Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp to authenticate.
4. Set up automated responses and scheduled messages using the dashboard.
5. Configure LLM settings for your chatbot (personality, knowledge base, etc.).
6. Monitor message status and conversation analytics.

## Technical Considerations

### WhatsApp Limitations
- **Session Management**: WhatsApp Web sessions expire periodically
- **Terms of Service**: Unofficial API usage may violate WhatsApp ToS
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement throttling to avoid being blocked

### LLM Integration
- **Token Costs**: Monitor usage when using commercial APIs
- **Latency**: Consider response time requirements
- **Model Selection**: Balance between capability and performance

### Security
- **Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication
- **Data Storage**: Encrypt sensitive information
- **API Keys**: Secure storage of LLM provider credentials
